"""  WikiGraphCrawler.py

With python 2.7
A more complex variant of WikiCrawler.py.
It creates the directed graph of the links between Wikipedia articles that are accessible for a given maximum depth of recursivity. 
We build a list of dictionary of nodes and a list of edges represented by couples of node
Each node is a dictionary associated with a specific wikipedia article:  {id, url, title, redirected, stats}
The keyword stats is still empty but is create for future applications of NLP methods.

    ''' - a simple case of redirection: 
        link = 'Procedure_(computer_science)' ---->  title="subroutine"
    
        - a case of page not found : IEC_27040
    
        - a case of several redirection: there is several links for one single node: (one title , one id..)
        Feasible_set redirected to Feasible_region
        Candidate_solution also redirected to Feasible_region

    ''' LIMITATION:  
    When a node that is already added at depth 2 is also found at dept 1 , it is NOT treated recursively as a node of depth 1, but just as a node of depth 2.
    WE CAN REGARD IT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DEPT-FIRST TRAVERSAL and the principle that the first detection of the node dictates its depth level and its title. 
    
    WOULD BE BETTER WITH A BREADTH-FIRST TRAVERSAL instead of a DEPTH-FIRST ONE.

    ''' Performance problem:
    it seems slower after 
                 - transforming node['link'] in a list rather than a string, 
                 - replace....  in depthAddNode()
    
    WHY IS IT SO SLOW even for terminal nodes without any web scraping: 
         only comparisons 
         add element to a set
         append element to a list
